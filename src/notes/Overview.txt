MVP

data visualizer - Ergast is hard to view, not graphical, not friendly interface, like a long dropdown of driver names
This will be an easy way to quickly look up data like laptimes and pitstops, and see a graph. (can look per lap or over the course of the race)
key features
-auto complete driver names
-friendly race lookup (2021 Austrian Grand Prix)
-adding multiple drivers onto one graph for comparison
-lap view vs. race view
    -lap view is lap time vs. lap #
    -race view is lap # vs. time (???) idea being able to see when drivers change order


eventually - 
using that same data fetching ability, we can make variations of interface
- what if max was 0.2s slower per lap?
- get standard deviation of lap times per stint, run monte carlo sims
    - essentially asking the question: if we ran this race 1000 times, how different could the results be?
